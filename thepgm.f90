! Description (a.o.t. verb phrase): Interactive Pascal's Triangle.

! Main Loop Input - Enter program data, AND control the program.
!
! There is a basic need for three commands, each to be a single character: "decrease by one", "stay the same", and "increase by one".
! These are the commands for controlling the simulation.
!
! There can be, perhaps, less than basic needs for two more commands, which might be added later. Each can be one character.
! * "help" -- display instructions. We developers can do without this for now, and should not do it until we know what works.
! * "quit" -- exit the program.  "clean exit" is not required. For now, control-C works fine.
